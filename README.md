# HappyNumber

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers. 

For example:- 
19 -->1^2 + 9^2 
   -->1+81=82
   --> 8^2 + 2^2 
   -->64+4 =68 
   -->6^2 + 8^2=100 
   -->1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
 Hence 19 is a happy number
